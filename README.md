# Project-1-Frontend-Page
 a website for a motorcycle or motorbike company called "Moto-S". The HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, while the CSS file defines the styles and layout.  The webpage has a header section with a black background, a logo on the left, a navigation menu in the middle, and two buttons on the right ("Book Now" and "Email Us"). The navigation menu items include Home, Events, About-Us, and Contact-Us.  The main content area has a background image (bg.jpg) and a blurred container with a form. The form prompts users to enter their name, phone number, email, address, and country, presumably for booking a motorcycle or requesting more information.  Here are a few key details and potential issues I noticed:  Responsiveness: The website doesn't seem to be fully responsive, as there are no media queries or responsive design techniques implemented in the CSS file. This means the website may not display correctly on smaller screens or mobile devices. Image optimization: The logo image (logo.png) is not optimized for the web, which could lead to slow loading times, especially on mobile devices with limited bandwidth. Accessibility: There are no alternative text descriptions for images, which can be an accessibility issue for users with visual impairments or those using screen readers. Code organization: The CSS file could be better organized and commented for easier maintenance and collaboration. For example, grouping related styles together and using comments to separate sections or explain specific rules. Cross-browser compatibility: While the website may work correctly in some browsers, it's essential to test it across different browsers and versions to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.
